Imagine a person is using a typical web calendar application using these 4 technologies; MySql, Angular, Node, GraphQl.

Now imagine the person fills in a new event in the calendar app and presses save to create the event.

List the order in which those 4 technologies will be engaged at the moment the user clicks save.

1. Angular
2. Node
3. GraphQl
4. MySql

Feel free to write any additional thoughts or caveats here:

I think the user hits the ui Angular, then Node processes the GraphQl to communicate with MySql.

I'm ex military too and I'll move across the country and work 80+ hours a week every week for you if you give me this job.

Thank you for your consideration.
