Imagine a person is using a typical web calendar application using these 4 technologies; MySql, Angular, Node, GraphQl.

Now imagine the person fills in a new event in the calendar app and presses save to create the event.

List the order in which those 4 technologies will be engaged at the moment the user clicks save.

1.
2.
3.
4.

Feel free to write any additional thoughts or caveats here:
